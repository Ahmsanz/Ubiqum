# Ubiqum
This is the repository that hosts the projects developed during my training at Ubiqum Code Academy.

It contains four different projects: 

- NYSL web: the web site of a soccer team in Chicago. The purpose was to get familiar with HTML5 and CSS3, trying to give it a solid design.

- TGIF web: a web for the entity Transparent Government in Fact, focused on getting in touch with the basics of Javascript and continue developing skills with HTML5 and CSS3. 

- Bookstore: a brief project, really simple, with the only purpose of being developed in just one day and a half, as a way to test the coding skills under stressfull conditions like those of a tight deadline. 

- Mytinerary: complete web application developed applying the complete MERN (Mongo DB, Express, React and NodeJs) stack as a way to crystalize a whole front and back project.
